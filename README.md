Average Execution Time For Reference Program: 0.000000 seconds<br>
Average EXecution Time For Kernel Program: 0.000000 seconds<br>

Analysis: <br/>
After getting the average execution time of each vector, it can be said that the length of the vector and the average execution time are dependent of each other. As the length of each vector increases, the execution time also increases. This is because a vector with a larger size increases the size of the memory needed to be allocated for the read and write operations, resulting in longer execution times.
